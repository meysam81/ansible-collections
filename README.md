A collection of personally often used Ansible roles and playbooks.

These tend to be useful for my own use case and projects but feel free to open
a PR or an issue in case you want anything specific added.

## Usage

To use this collection, you can add it as a dependency in your `requirements.yml`
file:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: meysam81.general
    version: 1.0.1
```
